## Hackathons
### TulaHack 2021
As a team of 5 people, we built a peer-to-peer messaging app that uses websockets to send messages between users. [The authentication service](https://github.com/Big-Kotik/p2p-chat-backend) is written in Java and uses JWT tokens. [The node server](https://github.com/Big-Kotik/p2p-ws-network) that handles websocket communitation is written in Go. It supports chat rooms with multiple people and relaying messages between nodes.
